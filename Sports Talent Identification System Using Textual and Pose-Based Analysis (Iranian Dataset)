# Sports Talent Identification Application

This project presents a simple sports talent identification system developed as a final course project.  
The goal of the project is to recommend a suitable sport for a user based on **textual physical information** and **pose analysis from images or videos**.

The system is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use, while relying on basic artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques.

---

## Project Description

Talent identification in sports is usually done based on experience and observation.  
In this project, a basic automated system is implemented to assist in this process using two stages:

1. Analysis of textual and physical information  
2. Analysis of body posture using image or video input (Pose Detection)

The final output of the system is a recommendation for an appropriate sports field such as volleyball, basketball, or football.

---

## Project Objectives

- Collect basic physical information from the user
- Analyze textual data to provide an initial sports recommendation
- Analyze body posture using image or video input
- Use pose detection to evaluate physical abilities
- Provide a final sports recommendation
- Keep the system fast and lightweight

---

## System Overview

The system consists of two main modules:

### 1. Text-Based Analysis
In this stage, the user enters basic information such as:
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Physical activity level
- Interest in team or individual sports

This data is processed using simple rule-based logic to suggest suitable sports.

### 2. Pose-Based Analysis
In the second stage, the user uploads an image or short video.  
Using pose detection, the system analyzes body posture and joint angles to evaluate physical capabilities such as balance, flexibility, and jumping ability.

## Dataset

Two types of data are used in this project:

- **Textual Dataset**:  
  A small, Iranian-based physical fitness dataset created according to common physical education standards used in Iran.  
  The dataset is stored in CSV format and has a very small size.

- **Image and Video Data**:  
  Images and videos are provided directly by the user.  
  No large external datasets are required.

This approach helps keep the project lightweight and fast.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- OpenCV  
- MediaPipe Pose  
- Pandas  
- Streamlit (for the application interface)

## Sample Code

### Text-Based Analysis (text_analysis.py)

```python
def recommend_sport_text(age, height, weight, activity_level, interest):
    if height > 185 and interest == "team":
        return "Volleyball or Basketball"
    elif activity_level == "high" and interest == "team":
        return "Football"
    elif activity_level == "low":
        return "Individual sports such as athletics"
    else:
        return "General fitness activities"
````

---

### Pose Detection Module (pose_analysis.py)

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp

mp_pose = mp.solutions.pose
pose = mp_pose.Pose()

def analyze_pose(image_path):
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    image_rgb = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    results = pose.process(image_rgb)

    if results.pose_landmarks:
        return "Pose detected successfully. Suitable for dynamic sports."
    else:
        return "Pose not detected clearly."
```

---

### Main Application (app.py)

```python
import streamlit as st
from text_analysis import recommend_sport_text
from pose_analysis import analyze_pose

st.title("Sports Talent Identification System")

st.header("Text-Based Analysis")
age = st.number_input("Age", 10, 60)
height = st.number_input("Height (cm)", 140, 210)
weight = st.number_input("Weight (kg)", 40, 120)
activity = st.selectbox("Activity Level", ["low", "medium", "high"])
interest = st.selectbox("Interest", ["team", "individual"])

if st.button("Analyze Text Data"):
    result = recommend_sport_text(age, height, weight, activity, interest)
    st.write("Recommended Sport:", result)

st.header("Pose-Based Analysis")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload an image", type=["jpg", "png"])

if uploaded_file:
    with open("temp.jpg", "wb") as f:
        f.write(uploaded_file.read())
    pose_result = analyze_pose("temp.jpg")
    st.write(pose_result)
```

## Results

The system is able to provide a basic recommendation for suitable sports based on both physical information and body posture analysis.
While the system does not replace professional coaching, it can be used as a supporting tool for initial talent identification.

## Conclusion and Future Work

In this project, a simple and efficient sports talent identification system was developed.
The focus was on low computational cost, fast execution, and the use of local data.

Future improvements may include:

* Adding more sports fields
* Using more advanced machine learning models
* Improving pose analysis accuracy
* Real-time video processing
